# Trading Tweaks

**Features:**
* Consumer stations, factories and trading posts now display goods in alphabetical order.
* You can now turn off buying/selling for trading stations and consumer stations.
* You can now adjust price margin for consumer stations (globally) and trading stations (per good).
* When player founds station/factory, mod adds 'traders' and 'passing ships' scripts to a sector.
* Players can no longer trade with station if it has trading turned off.
* Player-owned trading stations no longer consume goods over time.

* Fixes exploit that allowed to trade with stations from any distance.
* Fixes exploit that allowed to manipulate good price via factory margin.
